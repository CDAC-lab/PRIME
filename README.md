# Patient Reported Information Multidimensional Exploration (PRIME)
<p align="justify">PRIME is an automated platform to investigate Online Support Group (a.k.a. health forums, online health groups) discussions for extraction and analysis of patient-reported information. </p>

### Source and Binaries
<p align="justify">The java source of PRIME is included in the <strong>src</strong> folder which needs to be build using JAVA 1.8 and the dependencies included in the <strong>pom.xml</strong> need to be linked using <strong>maven</strong>.</p>

<p align="justify">The executable version of PRIME is included in the <strong>bin</strong> folder with the execution instructions.</p>


### Data
<p align="justify">PRIME was trialled on publicly available, patient-reported information on Online Support Groups. Techniques used for extraction of this data are included in this code repository.</p>

### Contributors 
<p align="justify">PRIME is a collaborative effort from the machine learning researchers of <a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/centre-for-data-analytics-and-cognition "><strong>Research Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition</strong></a> with the guidance  and support from the clinicians at <a href="http://www.austin.org.au"><strong>Austin Health</strong></a>.</p>

### Publications:
<p align="justify">The architecture, algorithms are explained and the results are discussed in the following publications.</p>
